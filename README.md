For my third project of the Code Institute course, I chose to make a recipe cookbook. I wanted a website that would be easy to navigate and welcoming to new users of any age. I really enjoyed my time devolping it and definitely see myself using it to store recipes that I randomly come accross on the internet. I feel like it's a much more interactive and fun way of storing meal plans compared to just bookmarking them. I'm happy with how it turned out and look forward to adding more to it as I continue my journey learning to code.

## User Experience (UX)

- #### User Goals

    1. I want the cookbook to be easy to use. I would very much like if there was a search feature availible on the website as it would make it so much easier to find a recipe that contains ingrediants I need to use up.

    1. I want to be able to add my own recipe. It would be cool to be allowed contribute to the contents of the cookbook and share my own recipes with other people.

    1. I would like a profile type feature on the website so I could keep track of who was posting what. If I'm sharing my own recipes, it's important to be given credit.


- #### Developers Goals

    1. I want to be able to add/remove cuisine types in the cookbook. It's important to have a wid

    1. I want to be able to edit recipes. Some users may need to use other ingrediants because of family dietry needs. I don't want any user who decided to use the cookbook to be left out

    1.  I want my site to be secure. As an admin this is important. There needs to be functionality in place that will stop unwated changes to the cookbook. Users shouldn't be able to edit something they didn't submit.
  

- #### Design

    * **Colour Scheme:** I chose a white background for the majority of the website as I wanted the contents of the recipes and all other information to be as easy to read as possible. I used a lot of the same colours on each of the buttons so that the user would be familiar with them. For example, the red buttons are generally for reseting or deleting information where as the green ones are for editing or submiting new information.

   * **Icons:** The icons used in this project help guide the user throughout the cookbook. On the form to add new recipes, they greatly improve the experience and show what information needs to be added in each of the input fields.

    * **Images:** On the main landing page of the project, I used a card-panel containing an image of the finished recipe to help the user decide what they would like to try. For me I felt adding images was essential as they play an important role in user experience. Everyone likes to see what they're going to be making!
